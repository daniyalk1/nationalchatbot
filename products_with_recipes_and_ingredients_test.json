Here's a simple recipe for Vanilla Custard that you can use as a starting point, and later, you can explore different ways to incorporate it into your meals.\n\nIngredients:\n1. 2 cups (473 ml) whole milk\n2. 2 large eggs\n3. 3/4 cup (150 grams) granulated sugar\n4. 1/4 cup (30 grams) cornstarch\n5. 1 vanilla bean, split and scraped, or 2 teaspoons (10 ml) pure vanilla extract\n6. 2 tablespoons (30 grams) unsalted butter\n\nInstructions:\n1. In a medium-sized saucepan, combine milk, sugar, cornstarch, and the vanilla bean seeds (or extract). Whisk until the sugar is dissolved.\n\n2. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs. Gradually pour some of the milk mixture into the eggs, whisking constantly, to temper the eggs. This process will prevent the eggs from cooking and scrambling.\n\n3. Pour the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan with the milk, and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly with a heatproof spatula or whisk.\n\n4. Cook until the custard thickens and begins to bubble around the edges, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the butter until fully incorporated.\n\n5. Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl, pressing on the solids to extract as much custard as possible. If you used vanilla extract instead of a bean, you can skip this step.\n\n6. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap directly onto the surface of the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill in the refrigerator until cold, at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.\n\nCommon uses for Vanilla Custard:\n1. As a dessert topping for fruits, cakes, or pastries\n2.
